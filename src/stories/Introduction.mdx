# Welcome to T-rapy Design System

This is the Storybook for the T-rapy web application. It serves as a living documentation for our UI components, ensuring consistency and reusability across the project.

## Organization

The components are organized into the following categories:

- **UI**: Core UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.) built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
- **Layout**: High-level layout components like Navbar and Footer.
- **Pages**: Full page stories to visualize how components come together.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Components**: Radix UI (Headless UI primitives)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Validation**: Zod + React Hook Form

## Getting Started

To use these components in your application, simply import them from `@/components/ui/[component-name]`.

Example:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

export default function MyComponent() {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>;
}
```
